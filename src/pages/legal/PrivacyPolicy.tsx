            Thank you for accessing the platform made available by Gauge
            Automotive, Inc. (“Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). We take your
            privacy very seriously. Our goal is to always be transparent and
            explain our privacy policy in the clearest way possible what
            personal information we collect, how we use it and what rights you
            have in relation to it. All the personal information we have access
            to will be collected, processed and protected consistent with
            applicable data protection laws, and we never sell or broker
            protected or personally-identifiable information. This Privacy
            Policy addresses what we do with your personal information as you
            access and use the auction tools and other items described as
            “Services” in our agreement with you. It does not cover what our
            clients (who may be dealers) do with your personal information.
            Those clients are subject to applicable laws and regulations, and
            they are responsible to act within the law and their own privacy
            policies. We provide the Services to help our clients collect and
            process personal information about you and the vehicles you are
            selling, but our clients control the purposes and means of that
            collection and processing, so they must govern themselves according
            to applicable law, as well as by our contracts with them. If you
            browse our website, we use Google Analytics to understand to improve
            the quality and relevance of the content on our website. This
            information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name
            or contact information).
