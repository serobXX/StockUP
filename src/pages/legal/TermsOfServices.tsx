            Gauge Automotive offers cutting edge software tools and services
            (“Services”) that allow licensed vehicle dealers and sellers to
            conveniently connect with each other. These Dealer Terms and
            Conditions (the “Agreement”) are between Gauge Automotive, Inc.
            (“Gauge,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or derivative terms) and the
            individual or entity accessing or using any portion of the Services,
            as well such entity’s legal agents or representatives (collectively,
            "you"). If you are an individual acting on behalf of a company, you
            personally warrant and represent that you are authorized to act on
            behalf of the company and that this Agreement will be binding on the
            company you represent.

          <span>
            By clicking “I Accept” or otherwise using or accessing the Services,
            you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions, as amended
            from time to time by Gauge:
          </span>
          <span>
            <b> 1. Agreement and Amendment:</b> This Agreement governs your use
            of and access to the website, software, online tools, and other
            delivery services made available by Gauge. Gauge may amend these
            terms any time by posting an amended version on its website. Such
            amended version shall become effective on the date of posting. This
            Agreement may not be amended in any other manner, except by written
            agreement signed by both parties.
          </span>
          <span>
            <b>2. Accuracy of Information:</b> You warrant and represent that
            all licensing, registration and representative information you have
            provided to us, whether via the Services or other medium, is true,
            correct, current, and complete. You agree to keep up-to-date the
            information you provide us.
          </span>
          <span>
            <b> 3. Registration:</b> You must register with us before accessing
            the Services. Registration will include verification that you are a
            licensed dealer, and we may request proof of such licensure.
            Registration will also require that you connect a bank account with
            us for payment purposes. Without connecting your bank account, you
            will not be allowed to start bidding or using the Services. You will
            be able to set your email & SMS notification preferences in your
            account settings at this time.
          </span>
          <span>
            <b> 4. Tax Exempt:</b> You represent and warrant to us that your
            purchases through us are for resale only and exempt from any state
            sales tax and agree that you, and not Gauge, are responsible to pay
            any taxes or tariffs on your related or subsequent transactions.
          </span>
          <span>
            <b> 5. Bidding Reserves and Improper Conduct:</b> Unless announced
            otherwise during the sale, all units are sold with reserve, and the
            auctioneer may bid up to the reserve. Bidders should remain aware
            and satisfy themselves as to a unit‘s condition and value before
            bidding and bring any incidents of improper bidding to management’s
            attention immediately at the close of bidding on a unit. Otherwise,
            participants ratify the auction of the unit. If you engage in any
            improper conduct, Gauge may immediately bar you from use of the
            Services.
          </span>
          <span className="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <b>6. Bidding Process. </b>
            <p>
              (a) You will bid on the vehicles based on the condition reports we
              provide. You will not get the opportunity to see the vehicles
              in-person prior to bidding.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              (b) Before placing a bid, you will see the buy fee and
              transportation cost that you will be charged if you win the bid.
            </p>
            <p>
              (c) You will be able to place a proxy bid, where you enter your
              maximum bid amount and our Services place the lowest bid possible,
              and then continues to bid up to your maximum bid amount as other
              dealers outbid you.
            </p>
            <p>
              (d) When you win a bid, we will notify you and send a pdf invoice
              to your accounting department, but we will not trigger the ACH
              pull to pay for the vehicle & fees until we have the vehicle in
              our possession.
            </p>
            <p>
              (e) After a bid that you have placed has been accepted, you may
              not back out of a purchase, and Gauge reserves the right to impose
              a fee of 10% of the transaction total if you back out of the
              transaction. Gauge reserves the right to waive any or all of such
              fee in its sole and absolute discretion without waiving the right
              to impose the fee in future transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              (f) We will deliver the vehicle and paperwork to you, and do a
              dealer transfer with the vehicle, which typically only involves
              signing over the title and filling out a bill of sale. Because
              these transactions are between two licensed dealers, no sales tax
              will be charged, provided you have given us your tax exemption ID.
            </p>
            <p>
              (g) If the seller has a loan on the vehicle you have purchased, we
              will take commercially reasonable steps to clear the lender from
              the title. You agree to cooperate reasonably with us in this
              effort.

          </span>
          <span className="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <b>7.Terms of Sale:</b> You agree to the following terms of sale for
            each vehicle you buy or sell through Gauge ("Vehicle"), as well as
            the Gauge Arbitration Policies (as defined below) that apply in the
            jurisdiction of sale:
            <p>
              {" "}
              (a) You are the transferee and agree to purchase the Vehicle;
              Gauge will take title to the Vehicle from the seller and agrees to
              sell the Vehicle to you after you go through the bidding process
              with the seller. However, the seller from whom Gauge obtained the
              Vehicle will be considered the seller for purposes of liability to
              you and third parties, since Gauge is merely the auctioneer or
              facilitator in the transaction. Gauge expressly disclaims any and
              all express and/or implied warranties or conditions as to
              merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular
              purpose, or any other matter whatsoever with respect to a Vehicle,
              and Gauge, not being the deemed seller of the Vehicle, makes no
              warranty whatsoever with respect to title to the Vehicle, other
              than the limited title guarantee set forth below. You acknowledge
              and agree that you are a sophisticated commercial party and agree
              to satisfy yourself as to the condition and value of a Vehicle and
              the terms of any bid before bidding or selling. You further agree
              to look to the counter-party seller in such a transaction, and not
              Gauge, for any legal claims falling outside your rights under the
              Gauge Arbitration Policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              (b) Any adjustments or rejections must be asserted at the time we
              deliver a Vehicle to you and must be resolved prior to settlement.
              Before settling for any Vehicle, you agree to check the serial
              and/or engine numbers on such Vehicle with those on the
              certificate of title and to compare the actual condition of such
              Vehicle with its description and with the announcements and seller
              disclosures; Vehicles must be paid for on the day of purchase, or
              Gauge may, at its discretion, impose fees as described below in
              this Agreement and/or consider the sale null and void. You agree
              to make any claim related to the condition of a Vehicle solely
              against the seller of the Vehicle and not Gauge.
            </p>
            <p>
              (c) Title to a Vehicle does not pass to you until good funds are
              received by Gauge, notwithstanding delivery to you. You grant
              Gauge a security interest in each Vehicle to secure payment of the
              purchase price and of any other debt owing from you to Gauge.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              (d) You agree to purchase the applicable Vehicle for the purchase
              price displayed on the online platform as the purchase price of
              the Vehicle, and shown on the final bill of sale or other final
              purchase receipt from us.
            </p>
            <p>
              (e) You agree that, upon acceptance of an offer by a seller, Gauge
              may immediately initiate the funds transfer from you, regardless
              of whether title has been transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
              (f) You represent and warrant to Gauge that you are solvent, that
              you are a licensed or duly authorized motor vehicle dealer in good
              standing or otherwise authorized to sell or buy on a commercial
              wholesale basis in the relevant jurisdiction(s), and that any
              Vehicle you purchase is purchased solely for resale.

            <b>8. Title Guarantee and Limitations.</b> After you have paid in
            full for a Vehicle and taken delivery, Gauge will guarantee title to
            be free and clear of liens and encumbrances as of such delivery as,
            and only as, follows:
            <p>
              ( a) The limited guarantee of title will last for a period of four
              years after the date of sale, and only to stolen Vehicles and
              mortgage liens. The amount of Gauge's liability under this limited
              guarantee of title shall never exceed the purchase price of the
              Vehicle and shall be reduced by deducting from the sale price two
              percent (2%) on the first of each month following the date of sale
              until the date of payment, with all liability of Gauge expiring
              and terminating on the first day of the 48th month after that
              date.
            </p>
            <p>
              (b) Gauge's limited guarantee of title is expressly limited to you
              and is not negotiable or transferable. The limited guarantee does
              not apply to defects of which you were aware or which were listed
              in the condition report or bill of sale for such Vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
              (c) Whenever any claim is made by any person against the title of
              any Vehicle, whether by suit or otherwise, you must, within five
              (5) days after becoming aware of said claim, notify Gauge, giving
              full particulars of the claim, and shall cooperate fully in
              defending any legal action and in taking any other steps to
              minimize possible loss. Failure to satisfy these conditions shall
              void Gauge's liability under this limited guarantee.
            </p>
            <p>
              (d) You will not surrender possession of any Vehicle, except as
              required by legal process, to any claimant, nor shall you
              voluntarily pay or acknowledge the validity of any such claim, in
              each case without the prior written approval of Gauge.
            </p>
            <p>
              (e) On payment of any claim under this limited guarantee, you will
              return the applicable Vehicle to Gauge and subrogate your rights
              to Gauge.

            following disclaimers and indemnifications
            <p>
              (a) You agree that Gauge is not responsible for any information

              any Vehicle are solely the responsibility of the seller, and you
              acknowledge and agree that Gauge has made no representations or
              disclosures whatsoever about any Vehicle, including any
              representation as to the accuracy of data included in vehicle
              history or condition reports.

              and against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage, or expense,
              including attorneys’ and legal fees, as applicable, which are in

              the purchase or sale of any Vehicle, (b) any matters relating to

              transporters or other agents of either you or the seller, and (e)
              any breach by you of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

            <p>
              (e) NOWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY

              SOLE DISCRETION.

            </a>
            We participate in vehicle arbitration based on the rules described
            in the NAAA policies, with the understanding that for purposes of
            construing the NAAA policies, you are the buyer and the vehicle
            seller (not Gauge) is the seller. You agree that any dispute arising
            from the purchase or sale of a Vehicle through Gauge will be
            resolved in this manner. Our decisions as third-party arbitrator
            (notwithstanding the fact that we have technically bought and sold
            the title) under the guidelines shall be final and binding upon you
            with respect to any transaction.
          </span>
          <span>
            <b> 11. Payments:</b> Payments for goods or services must be made
            using the bank account you connected at registration. If any payment
            to Gauge is reversed for any reason without Gauge’s prior written
            consent, you will pay a service charge of $100.00 and interest of
            the lesser of (a) 18% annually and (b) the greatest amount allowed
            by law if lesser than (a). Gauge may waive these fees in its sole
            discretion.

            designate a bank account for payment of amounts you owe us,
            including, but not limited to, by adding a bank account to your
            online profile, we may use such account information to initiate ACH
            entries to your bank account, including debit entries for amounts
            you owe us from time to time as such amounts become due, credit
            entries for amounts we owe you, and debit or credit entries in any

              MEANS THAT YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST GAUGE WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH
              ARBITRATION RATHER THAN LITIGATION IN COURT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

              <b>(c) Arbitration Procedures/Arbitrator Authority:</b> Any
              dispute or claim subject to arbitration pursuant to this Section
              shall be submitted to binding arbitration administered by the
              Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service ("JAMS") pursuant to
              its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures as in effect at
              the time of the submission of such dispute or claim (the "JAMS
              Streamlined Rules"). The disputes and claims subject to
              arbitration pursuant to this Section will be resolved by a single
              arbitrator selected pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Rules. The
              arbitrator shall be bound by and shall strictly enforce This
              Agreement and any other applicable agreement between you and
              Gauge, and may not limit, expand, or otherwise modify any of This
              Agreement or the provisions of any other applicable agreement
              between you and Gauge. The arbitrator may award any relief that a
              court of law could, applying the limitations of liability
              contained in This Agreement. The arbitrator may award injunctive
              relief if permitted by law – but the injunctive relief awarded by
              the arbitrator may not extend beyond our dealings with each other.
              The laws of the State of Utah will apply to any claims or disputes
              between us. Any arbitration will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah,
              unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing. Each party
              will bear its own expenses in the arbitration and will share
              equally the costs of the arbitration; provided, however, that the
              arbitrator shall award Gauge any costs and fees to which Gauge may
              be entitled under this Agreement in connection with any
              indemnification claim, and may also, in his or her discretion,
              award cost and fees to Gauge if it is determined that you
              submitted or filed any arbitration in bad faith or that your
              claims against Gauge have no reasonable legal basis.
